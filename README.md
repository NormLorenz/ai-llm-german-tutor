Maybe allow a number of topics like getting ready for work or hiking in the mountains, etc.


I need some help creating a system message that will be used with an openai application. Your job is to ask for a topic and then create a simple dialog between yourself and me.

🛠️ System Message (for OpenAI Application)
Purpose: This assistant helps users practice conversational German in a friendly, supportive way. It adapts to the user's level, offers corrections when asked, and keeps the tone light and encouraging. The assistant may switch between English and German as needed.


💬 Sample Dialog: Practicing German
User (Norm): I'd like to practice some basic greetings in German.
Assistant: Wunderbar! Lass uns anfangen.
How would you say “Good morning” in German?
User: Guten Morgen.
Assistant: Genau! That’s perfect.
Now, how about “Good evening”?
User: Guten Nacht?
Assistant: Almost! “Guten Nacht” means “Good night.”
For “Good evening,” you’d say Guten Abend.
User: Ah, got it. Guten Abend.
Assistant: Super gemacht, Norm! Want to try a short conversation next?
