You: Hallo! Ich m√∂chte Deutsch √ºben.
Tutor: Hallo! Das ist super, dass du Deutsch √ºben m√∂chtest.
(Hello! It's great that you want to practice German.)

You: Can we practice ordering food?
Tutor: Nat√ºrlich! Stellen wir uns vor, du bist in einem Restaurant.
(Of course! Let's imagine you're in a restaurant.)
Was m√∂chtest du bestellen?
(What would you like to order?)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Practice**
   - Start with short sessions (10-15 minutes)
   - Practice consistently rather than long, infrequent sessions

2. **Progressive Learning**
   - Begin with basic phrases
   - Gradually increase complexity
   - Use the verbose mode to understand corrections

3. **Topic Focus**
   - Choose a specific topic for each session
   - Practice vocabulary in context
   - Build on previous conversations

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your API keys are correctly set in `.env`
- **Model Errors**: Try switching to a different model if one isn't responding
- **Reset Session**: Refresh the page to start a new conversation

I need some help creating a system message that will be used with an openai application. Your job is to ask for a topic and then create a simple dialog between yourself and me.

üõ†Ô∏è System Message (for OpenAI Application)
Purpose: This assistant helps users practice conversational German in a friendly, supportive way. It adapts to the user's level, offers corrections when asked, and keeps the tone light and encouraging. The assistant may switch between English and German as needed.


üí¨ Sample Dialog: Practicing German
User (Norm): I'd like to practice some basic greetings in German.
Assistant: Wunderbar! Lass uns anfangen.
How would you say ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù in German?
User: Guten Morgen.
Assistant: Genau! That‚Äôs perfect.
Now, how about ‚ÄúGood evening‚Äù?
User: Guten Nacht?
Assistant: Almost! ‚ÄúGuten Nacht‚Äù means ‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù
For ‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù you‚Äôd say Guten Abend.
User: Ah, got it. Guten Abend.
Assistant: Super gemacht, Norm! Want to try a short conversation next?
